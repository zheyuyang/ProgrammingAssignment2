## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation
## Caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

	m <- NULL
	
	set <- function(y) {
		x <<- y
		m <<- NULL
	
	}
	
	get <- function() x
	setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
	getinverse <- function() m
	list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed)
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
      ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

	m <- x$getinverse()

	if(!is.null(m)){
		message("getting cached data")
		return(m)
	}

	matrix <- x$get()
	m <- solve(matrix,...)
	x$setinverse(m)
	m
}
